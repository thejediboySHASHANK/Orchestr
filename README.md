- **AI Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with AI technologies to enhance functionality.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Tailor workflows to meet the specific needs of your processes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, intuitive interface that makes automation accessible to everyone.

### How It Works

Upon launching, the server begins listening for incoming TCP connections. When a connection is established, it accepts the connection and spins off a new thread dedicated to handling that specific client. Each thread performs the following tasks:
- Parses the clientâ€™s HTTP request.
- Checks the cache for a stored response.
- If cached, returns the response directly to the client.
- If not cached, forwards the request to the designated remote server, retrieves the response, sends it back to the client, and stores it in the cache.

This architecture not only enhances the responsiveness of the proxy server but also significantly reduces unnecessary network traffic by serving repeated requests directly from the cache.


## Demo

- When website is opened for the first time `(url not found)` then cache will be missed.
- Then if you again open that website again then `Data is retrieved from the cache` will be printed.

## How to Run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thejediboySHASHANK/WebServerLRU.git
$ cd WebServerLRU
$ make all
$ ./proxy <port no.>
```

- This code can only be ran in a Linux Machine or in WSL.
- Please disable your browser cache.
